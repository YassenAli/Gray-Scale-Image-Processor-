# Gray Scale Image Processor

An image processing software designed for manipulating grayscale and RGB images with various filters and operations.

## Description

This project provides functionality similar to photo editing software, allowing users to load images, apply filters, and save modified versions. Filters include operations like converting to black and white, inverting colors, merging images, flipping, rotating, adjusting brightness, detecting edges, enlarging, shrinking, mirroring, shuffling, blurring, cropping, and skewing.

### Filters Overview

1. **Black and White Image:** Converts the image to black and white based on average gray level.
2. **Invert Image:** Produces the negative of the image.
3. **Merge Images:** Creates a new image by averaging pixel values of two images.
4. **Flip Image:** Flips the image horizontally or vertically.
5. **Rotate Image:** Rotates the image by 90ยบ, 180ยบ, or 270ยบ.
6. **Darken and Lighten Image:** Adjusts brightness of the image.
7. **Detect Image Edges:** Converts the image to a sketch-like version highlighting edges.
8. **Enlarge Image:** Enlarges one quarter of the image into a new image.
9. **Shrink Image:** Reduces image dimensions by factors of 2, 3, or 4.
a. **Mirror Image:** Mirrors sections of the image.
b. **Shuffle Image:** Rearranges quarters of the image based on user input.
c. **Blur Image:** Applies a blur effect to the image.
d. **Crop Image:** This filter allows entering an x, y position and cutting a square of length and width l, w to keep and removing the rest.
e, f. **Skew Horizontally / Vertically:** Skews the image to the right or up.
